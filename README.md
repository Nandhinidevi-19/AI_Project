# Detection of Image Recolouring through CNN

This repository contains the code and resources for my project.

## Files

- **app.py**: Main application script
- **code1.py**: Actual code for the project
- **static/**: Contains static assets like images and styles
- **templates/**: Contains HTML templates
- **test.py**: Test script for the model

## Model and Dataset Files

The `.keras` model file and the edited dataset are too large to be uploaded directly to GitHub. You can download them from the following links:

- **Model File**: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wIi-jbUa7DZjPExSeJom4ZVifdwPNjvM
- **Dataset**: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1tMV7bVwGXM87lqwmYs61wfT2Bkd-S3-m

Once downloaded, extract the `.keras` model file and place it in the project directory, and extract the dataset to the appropriate location for your application.
